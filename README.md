# Grassland_Mongolia
Mapping grassland in Naiman, Mongolia 

Growing demand for resopurces from China's grassland and impact of climate change continues to threaten the long-term health of vital ecosytems. Uisng High-Resolution CORONA imgery obtained from the United States through the spy mission in the 1960s, a comprehensive landuse classifacation is created to provide a historical insight of land conditions in prior decades.

## Getting Started
These instruction will help to be replicate the moethodogy.

## Installation
The analysis was carried out using python 3.8. Other packages needed can be found in the .yaml file. 


## Exploratory data analysis 
Exploratory data analysis was first carreid out to understand the data and address other data issues. They include correlation matrix, histogram and spectral signature plots of contextual features. 

## Explanble machine leanring 
Three machine leanirng classifiers were experimented. They are Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and MultiLayer Perceptron. SHAP was used to explain the important variables used my the model. this allow sus to know which contextual features are useful for grasslnad mapping.
